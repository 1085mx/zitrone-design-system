# Zitrone Positioning
## Feeding modern work

### This is a point of view.  
Not a service description.

---

## The World Has Changed. Workplace Food Hasn’t.

Work has transformed.

How we move.  
How we communicate.  
How we build culture.  
How we expect experiences to feel.

But workplace food is still treated like:
- A commodity
- A cost center
- A checklist
- A vendor problem

Something to “handle,” not something to care about.

That disconnect shows up every day:
- In empty cafeterias
- In daily complaints
- In rigid systems that don’t fit real life
- In food that technically works — but never inspires

---

## We Believe Food Is Not a Detail

Food is not a perk.  
Food is not a menu.  
Food is not a line item.

Food is:
- A daily ritual
- A shared experience
- A signal of what a company values
- One of the few moments everyone feels at work

When food is done right:
- People feel cared for
- Culture becomes tangible
- The day flows better
- Work feels more human

When it’s done wrong:
- Friction spreads
- Complaints grow
- Trust erodes quietly

---

## The Zitrone Belief

We believe feeding people at work is a responsibility.

Not just to nourish bodies —  
but to support energy, connection, rhythm, and care.

And we believe that responsibility should be carried by a system —  
not improvised, outsourced, or pushed onto employees to tolerate.

---

## What Zitrone Exists to Do

Zitrone exists to design and run the food experience of modern work.

We don’t just serve meals.  
We shape how food lives inside a company — every day.

That means:
- Food people actually want to eat
- Experiences people look forward to
- Systems that flex with real life
- Operations that don’t break under pressure

All without turning food into something teams have to manage, worry about, or defend.

## From Food Service to Food System

The old model:  
> “Here are our services. Choose what you need.”

The Zitrone model:  
> “Here’s how food should work in your company.”

We design food as a living system:
- One that adapts as teams grow or shift
- One that feels local and personal
- One that stays safe, reliable, and grounded
- One that disappears into the background — until it delights

---

## The Zitrone Idea

### Food that works the way modern companies do.

Human.  
Flexible.  
Intentional.  
Designed, not accidental.

Built to support how people actually work today —  
not how workplaces used to operate.

---

## This Is Not Functional Food

Yes, food must be:
- Safe
- Reliable
- Well-operated

That is the baseline.

But food is also:
- Emotional
- Cultural
- Sensory
- Symbolic

Zitrone treats food as:
- A craft
- A responsibility
- A daily expression of care

Because people don’t remember spreadsheets —  
they remember how things made them feel.

---

## Who This Is For

Zitrone is for companies that:
- Care about people, not just productivity
- Move fast but think long-term
- Believe experience is part of performance
- Expect partners to think, not just execute

Companies where:
- Culture matters
- Experience scales
- Food is part of the story

---

## What We Refuse to Be

We refuse to be:
- Just another vendor
- Just another cafeteria
- Just another “healthy option”
- Just another checklist of services

We don’t believe modern companies should sound generic —  
or eat generic food.

---

## Proof Lives in the Everyday

Zitrone’s success doesn’t live in claims.

It lives in:
- Cafeterias people actually use
- Food that feels thoughtful
- Systems that don’t fall apart
- Fewer complaints
- More shared moments

When food works, you feel it.  
When it doesn’t, you really feel it.

---

## The Line We Stand Behind

### Feeding modern work.

Because how a company feeds its people  
says everything about how it works.

---

## The Standard

If this doesn’t feel bold, it’s wrong.  
If this doesn’t feel human, it’s empty.  
If this doesn’t make food feel meaningful again, it’s incomplete.

This is not about food service.  
This is about how work feels, every day.
