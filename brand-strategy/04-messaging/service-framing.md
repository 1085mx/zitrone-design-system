# Zitrone Services
## How food supports the rhythm of work

Zitrone services are designed around outcomes —  
how people feel, move, and work throughout the day.

Each service is a different expression of the same system:
food that keeps pace, care built in, friction removed.

## One System, Many Expressions

Zitrone services are not separate offerings.
They are connected expressions of the same system.

Clients don’t assemble solutions.
They start where it makes sense — and the system adapts.

As teams grow.  
As needs change.  
As work evolves.

---

## Choosing Where to Begin

Some organizations start with daily dining.  
Others with cafés, pantry, or catering.

There’s no wrong entry point —
because every service is designed to work together.

What matters is not the format.
It’s how food feels once it’s in place.

## The Principle Behind Every Service

**Food that keeps pace.**

Across every space.  
Every moment.  
Every workday.
