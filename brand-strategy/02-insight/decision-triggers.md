# Decision Triggers
## What Actually Causes Zitrone Buyers to Move

### Purpose of This Document
This document defines the **real decision triggers** that cause Zitrone’s ideal buyers
(Uber / Salesforce / Netflix / Pinterest–type companies) to **initiate, accelerate,
or finally commit** to a decision.

It explains:
- What breaks status quo bias
- What creates urgency without pressure
- What moments convert interest into commitment
- How Zitrone should recognize and activate these triggers

This is a **decision activation map**, not a sales tactics list.

## 1) Core Truth: Decisions Move When Risk Shifts

In corporate food services, buyers do not move because something is “better.”
They move when:
- The **risk of staying the same** becomes greater than
- The **risk of changing providers**

All decision triggers below operate by **rebalancing perceived risk**.

---

## 2) Primary Decision Triggers (Category-Level)

These are the most common, high-impact triggers across the market.

---

## 2.1 Incident Risk (Explicit or Near-Miss)

### What Happens
- Food safety concern
- Audit pressure
- Health incident (even if minor)
- Near-miss that creates internal anxiety

### Psychological Effect
- Fear spikes
- Status quo becomes unsafe
- Buyers look for *structural reassurance*, not just fixes

### What Buyers Say
- “We can’t afford this happening again.”
- “We need tighter controls.”
- “Leadership is asking questions.”

### How Zitrone Should Respond
- Lead with governance and prevention systems
- Translate controls into buyer confidence
- Emphasize incident-proofing, not blame

## 2.2 Accumulated Friction (The Silent Trigger)

### What Happens
- Daily complaints

- Vendor follow-up fatigue

### Psychological Effect
- Emotional exhaustion
- Loss of trust
- Buyers start imagining alternatives

### What Buyers Say
- “It technically works, but it’s a headache.”

## 3) Secondary Decision Triggers (Accelerators)

These triggers often **don’t start** a deal — but they **speed it up**.

---

### What Happens

### Psychological Effect

- Connect food to daily employee sentiment

---

## 3.3 Vendor Failure Elsewhere

### What Happens
- Another outsourced vendor fails
- Trust in vendors drops
- Risk sensitivity increases

### Psychological Effect

- Demand for accountability

### Zitrone Activation
- Lead with ownership and escalation clarity
- Emphasize “we don’t disappear behind contracts”
- Highlight response and recovery processes

---

## 4) Personal Decision Triggers (Often Unspoken)

These are the **most powerful**, but rarely stated openly.

---

## 4.1 Reputation Protection

### What Buyers Think (But Don’t Say)
- “I can’t be blamed for this.”
- “This decision has to age well.”

### Zitrone Activation
- Provide defensible decision logic
- Offer proof, references, and clarity
- Frame Zitrone as the “responsible choice”

---

## 4.2 Cognitive Overload

### What Happens
- Buyers are overwhelmed with vendors and decisions
- Food feels like noise they want gone

### Zitrone Activation
- Simplify choices
- Recommend paths
- Reduce decision surface area

---

## 5) What Is *Not* a True Decision Trigger

Important to avoid false signals:

- Curiosity or “just exploring”
- Feature comparisons
- Menu tastings without context
- RFPs without internal urgency

Without a trigger, deals stall.
