# Category Dynamics
## Corporate Food Services in Mexico

### Purpose of this Document
This document explains how the corporate food services category actually behaves,
why most players sound identical, and why buyers struggle to decide.
It defines the structural forces that shape messaging, competition, and buying behavior.

This is not a marketing description of the category.
It is a decision and positioning analysis.

## 1. Category Definition

The corporate food services category includes outsourced services such as:
- Corporate and industrial cafeterias
- Employee dining programs
- Pantry and grab-and-go solutions
- Catering for meetings and events
- Coffee, beverage, and convenience services

Buyers are typically mid-to-large companies with:
- Offices, campuses, or industrial plants
- Mixed stakeholder decision committees
- High sensitivity to risk, continuity, and compliance

---

## 2. How the Category Historically Competes

The category has historically competed on **operational capability**, not outcomes.

Common competitive dimensions:
- Food quality
- Hygiene and certifications (e.g., Distintivo H)
- Menu variety
- Scale and years of experience
- Price per meal
- Ability to operate on-site

These dimensions became **table stakes**, not differentiators.

As a result:
- Nearly all providers describe themselves using the same language
- Differentiation collapses into price, availability, or procurement preference
- Buyers struggle to understand meaningful differences

## 3. Why the Category Sounds the Same

### Structural Reasons (Not Creative Failures)

1. **Procurement-driven buying**
   - Many decisions originate in procurement or operations
   - RFPs reward compliance, not insight
   - Messaging becomes defensive and generic

2. **Fear-based risk environment**
   - Food safety incidents carry reputational and legal risk
   - Providers over-index on “safety language” to avoid exclusion
   - Everyone emphasizes hygiene, certifications, and controls

3. **Multi-stakeholder committees**
   - HR, Facilities, Operations, Finance, EHS all participate
   - Messaging tries to please everyone
   - Result: vague, diluted positioning

4. **Service commoditization**
   - Services are perceived as interchangeable
   - Providers describe “what we do” instead of “what changes”

---

## 4. The Real Job Buyers Are Hiring For

Buyers are not hiring a food service.
They are hiring **operational certainty**.

Underlying jobs-to-be-done:
- Ensure employees are fed without friction
- Avoid incidents, complaints, and interruptions
- Reduce personal and organizational risk
- Maintain continuity regardless of demand fluctuations
- Protect internal reputation and decision credibility

Food is the medium — not the real value.

## 5. Emotional Drivers in the Category

Despite being B2B, decisions are emotionally charged.

Primary emotional drivers:
- Risk avoidance
- Fear of failure or incident
- Desire for control and predictability
- Desire to “make the safe choice”
- Personal reputation protection

This explains why:
- Status quo bias is extremely strong
- “Do nothing” is often the biggest competitor
- Buyers delay decisions unless clarity is very high

---

## 6. Why Listing Services Fails in This Category

Service-led messaging:
- Increases cognitive load
- Forces buyers to self-interpret relevance
- Expands choices instead of simplifying them
- Does not reduce perceived risk

As a result:
- Buyers default to familiar providers
- Or choose based on price alone
- Or stall the decision entirely

---

## 7. Strategic Implication

Winning in this category requires:
- Shifting from service description to decision clarity
- Framing the offering as a system, not a menu
- Anchoring value in outcomes and risk reduction
- Making the “right choice” feel obvious

This category rewards companies that design the decision,
not just deliver the service.
