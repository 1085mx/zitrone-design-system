# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
## Zitrone — Corporate Food Systems

### Purpose of this Document
This document defines Zitrone’s **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**.

It answers:
- Who Zitrone is built to serve best
- Why these customers value Zitrone’s model
- Where Zitrone wins decisively — and where it should not compete
- How this ICP should guide positioning, messaging, sales qualification, and delivery

This is a **strategic filter**, not a lead-generation list.

## 1) ICP Definition (Executive Summary)

- Are allergic to bureaucracy
- Expect enterprise-grade controls with human accountability
- Care deeply about employee experience, culture, and execution quality
- Have zero tolerance for operational surprises

Typical examples:
- Global or regional tech companies

## 2) Firmographic Profile (Who They Are)

### Company Size
- **Employees:** 200–5,000+  
- **On-site headcount:** 100–1,500 per location  
- **Multiple offices or hybrid footprints** (HQ + satellite offices, sometimes plants)

- Digital marketplaces
- Media, entertainment, and content platforms
- Innovation-led professional services

### Growth & Maturity
- Post-Series C to public company

## 3) Cultural & Operational Characteristics (Why They’re a Fit)

### How These Companies Operate
- Fast-paced, high-expectation environments
- Distributed decision-making
- Low tolerance for friction and delays
- Preference for partners who “just handle it”

### Cultural Markers
- Employee experience is strategic, not cosmetic
- Food is part of culture, retention, and daily rhythm
- Wellness, quality, and variety matter — but reliability matters more

### Vendor Expectations
- Proactive, not reactive
- Clear ownership and accountability

## 4) Buying Committee & Power Dynamics

### Core Stakeholders
- **Workplace / Facilities / Operations:** execution, continuity, vendor burden
- **People / HR:** experience, satisfaction, wellness, adoption
- **Finance:** predictability, waste control, cost clarity
- **Procurement (sometimes):** governance, contract hygiene
- **Local leadership:** day-to-day reality, complaints, continuity

### Decision Reality
- Decisions are **cross-functional**
- Risk perception is high
- Nobody wants to be blamed for a bad vendor choice
- Status quo bias is strong unless clarity is high

Zitrone wins when it:
- Reduces anxiety for *all* stakeholders at once
- Makes the decision feel safe, obvious, and defensible

## 5) The Core Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD)

Zitrone’s ICP is **not hiring food**.

They are hiring Zitrone to:

1. **Run workplace food without friction**
   - “I don’t want to think about this every day.”

2. **Protect the company from incidents**
   - “Nothing can go wrong — and if it does, it’s handled.”

3. **Deliver a great daily employee experience**
   - “People should actually want to use it.”

4. **Scale and adapt without re-negotiating everything**
   - “Our needs change — the system should flex.”

5. **Make decision-makers look competent**
   - “This choice should age well.”

## 6) Pain Signals That Indicate ICP Fit

Zitrone’s ideal customers often say things like:

- “Our current provider technically works, but everyone complains.”
- “We don’t want to manage five different food vendors.”
- “We need flexibility — our headcount changes all the time.”
- “Food is becoming part of our employee experience strategy.”
- “We can’t afford an incident or service failure.”
- “We want someone who owns this end-to-end.”

These are **ICP green flags**.
