# Zitrone — 2026 Sales Deck
## Food that keeps pace

---

# When food service works, teams feel it.
17+ years supporting demanding workdays.
We design and operate food service that fits the real rhythms of work,
supporting energy, focus, and well‑being through consistent quality
and thoughtful innovation.

By staying close to how teams actually use the service,
we make food feel seamless, dependable, and genuinely supportive of
everyday work.

---

# The shift
Work changed. Food didn’t.

- Work moves faster
- Teams change shape often
- Expectations rose

Food stayed a vendor problem.

---

# The tension
What buyers live with today:

- Food that works, but doesn’t fit
- Systems that break under change
- Experience that feels generic
- Wellness that feels performative

Friction spreads quietly.

---

# Reframe
Food is not a service.
Food is a system and an experience.

It shapes rhythm, energy, and care.
It should feel invisible until it delights.

---

# The idea
## Food that keeps pace.

Flow over friction.
Care without pressure.
Wellness without performance.
Systems over services.
Human leadership, sleeves rolled up.

---

# What buyers are really buying
Not meals.

They are buying:
- Certainty
- Risk reduction
- Operational stability
- Personal safety for the decision

Confidence beats features.

---

# The tensions we resolve
- Experience vs. risk
- Flexibility vs. control
- Cost vs. value
- Central governance vs. local reality
- Speed vs. safety

We collapse the trade‑offs by design.

---

# What Zitrone is
We design and run the food experience of modern work.

Not a vendor.
A system.

---

# What the system delivers
- Food people actually want to eat
- Experiences people look forward to
- Operations that hold under pressure
- Flexibility without fragility
- Less to manage

---

# Services as expressions
One system, many expressions.

- Daily Foundation (on‑site / off‑site kitchens)
- Everyday Pause (cafés)
- Food in Motion (service carts)
- Always Available (pantry)
- Moments That Matter (catering)
- Everyday Essentials (coffee + water)

Start where it makes sense.
The system adapts.

---

# Transition is a product
The highest anxiety is between “yes” and “it works.”

We treat transition as core:
- Clear ownership
- Visible progress
- Early wins
- Over‑communication

---

# Leadership that works alongside the team
Showing up every day, sleeves rolled up.

Founder‑led. Hands‑on.
In kitchens. In decisions.
Close to the work.

---

# Proof without hype
Signals that make trust feel reasonable:

- 17+ years in real environments
- Trusted by demanding organizations
- Founder‑led, close to operations
- Systems built for change
- Safety that becomes invisible
- Human accountability at scale
