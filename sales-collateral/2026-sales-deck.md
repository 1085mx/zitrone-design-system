# Zitrone — 2026 Sales Deck
## Food that keeps pace

---

# The shift
Work changed. Food didn’t.

- Work moves faster
- Teams change shape often
- Expectations rose

Food stayed a vendor problem.

---

# The tension
What buyers live with today:

- Food that works, but doesn’t fit
- Systems that break under change
- Experience that feels generic
- Wellness that feels performative

Friction spreads quietly.

---

# Reframe
Food is not a service.
Food is a system and an experience.

It shapes rhythm, energy, and care.
It should feel invisible until it delights.

---

# The idea
## Food that keeps pace.

Flow over friction.
Care without pressure.
Wellness without performance.
Systems over services.
Human leadership, sleeves rolled up.

---

# What buyers are really buying
Not meals.

They are buying:
- Certainty
- Risk reduction
- Operational stability
- Personal safety for the decision

Confidence beats features.

---

# Why change happens
Decisions move when the risk of staying
becomes greater than the risk of switching.

Common triggers:
- Incident risk
- Accumulated friction
- Organizational change
- Leadership change

---

- Early wins
- Over-communication

---
